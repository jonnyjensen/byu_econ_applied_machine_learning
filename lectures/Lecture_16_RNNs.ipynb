    "Recurrent neural networks - or RNNs - are built specifically to deal with sequence data. For example, suppose you have a sequence of text of movie reviews and would like to classify their sentiment, or a sequence of stock prices and you would like to predict the next one. These are all tasks well suited for an RNN.\n",

    "If you have variable length inputs, like movie reviews which differ in length. A decent technique is to pick a fairly large input sequence length and zero padd all the inputs which are smaller. See here:\n",

    "If you have variable length output sequences - for example, when generating text. You can define a special end of sequence tag such as <EOS> and ignore any output past that tag.\n",
